# Skin-lesion-classification-using-image-classification

Completed this project as part of my Advance Data Science Project with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

Studied and Analyzed the Skin lesion classification dataset to applying Image Classification algorithm and present my insights. Performed various stages like data preparation,architecture selection and training and validation to understand the data. Experimented with Machine Learning algorithm i.e., Neural Networks algorithm using different optimizers Adam and SGD. Compared the results to recommend the best Neural Network optimizer.
